This repository is used to document my journey on getting a better foundational knowledge of "DevOps".

The reason for documenting these days is so that others can take something from it and also hopefully enhance the resources.

This will not cover all things "DevOps" but it will cover the areas that I feel will benefit my learning and understanding overall.
